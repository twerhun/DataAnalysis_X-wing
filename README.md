# DataAnalysis_X-wing
Analysing selected aspects of the X-wing miniatures game

This is my first Data Analysis project, for which I have chosen the topic that I am personally passionate about - X-wing miniatures game.
In this project I try to explain basic rules of the game, and scetch the goal and expected outcome of the analysis.
Data is imported through excel sheet that I prepared and filled during x-wing game between two experienced players.
I processed and cleaned up gathered data using python data oriented libraries - pandas and numpy.
After preparing core tables I visualised selected key aspects of the game through matplotlib functionalities.
In this analysis I tried to find out what are the key factors that helps you become succesfull in x-wing game.
